# 🏦 Mortgage Client Portfolio Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes a portfolio of ~100 mortgage clients to uncover patterns in payment behavior, account risk, and opportunities to improve reporting efficiency. Based on real-world responsibilities from my role at Sunrise Credit Solutions, it demonstrates end-to-end data handling — from cleaning and structuring client data to building automated reports and actionable insights.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and structure raw mortgage account data for reporting  
- Analyze payment behavior, balances, and delinquency patterns  
- Build automated reporting to support decision-making for client management  

---

### 🧰 Tools
**SQL** (queries & aggregations) • **Excel & Tableau** (dashboards) • **Python (light)** for data cleaning  

---

### 📈 Key Insights
- Identified clients at highest risk of missed payments using loan term and payment history  
- Found clusters of late payments around variable interest rate adjustments  
- Automated recurring reports reduced manual reporting time significantly
