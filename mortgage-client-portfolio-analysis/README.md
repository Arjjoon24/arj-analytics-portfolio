# 🏡 Mortgage Client Portfolio Analysis

### Objective  
Analyze payment behavior, delinquency trends, and loan characteristics to identify portfolio risks and client segments requiring attention.

---

### 🔍 Key Questions:
- What are the delinquency trends by loan term length?  
- How are loan amounts distributed across clients?  
- Which months see the highest rate of late payments?  
- Are there patterns in repayment that suggest early risk indicators?  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
SQL • Excel • Tableau • Data Visualization • Financial Analytics  

---

### 📈 Key Insights:
- Clients with **longer loan terms (30+ years)** showed higher delinquency rates compared to shorter terms.  
- Loan amounts are **skewed toward mid-range values ($200k–$400k)** with fewer very high-value loans.  
- Late payments spiked in **March and September**, aligning with seasonal financial stress points.  
- Recommendations included **targeted outreach to high-risk loan segments** and **closer monitoring of seasonal delinquency cycles**.
