# 🏦 Mortgage Client Portfolio Analysis  

### Overview  
This project analyzes a portfolio of ~100 mortgage clients to uncover patterns in payment behavior, account risk, and opportunities to improve reporting efficiency. Based on real-world responsibilities from my role at Sunrise Credit Solutions, it demonstrates end-to-end data handling — from cleaning and structuring client data to building automated reports and actionable insights.
