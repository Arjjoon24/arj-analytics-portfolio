# Mortgage Client Portfolio Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes a portfolio of ~100 mortgage clients to uncover patterns in payment behavior, account risk, and opportunities to improve reporting efficiency. Based on real-world responsibilities from my role at Sunrise Credit Solutions, it demonstrates end-to-end data handling â€” from cleaning and structuring client data to building automated reports and actionable insights.

### Objectives
- Clean and structure raw mortgage account data for reporting
- Analyze payment behavior, balances, and delinquency patterns
- Build automated reporting to support decision-making for client management

### Data
Simulated dataset (modeled on real work) including:
- **Client Info:** Client ID, demographics
- **Mortgage Details:** Loan amount, interest rate, term, status
- **Payment History:** Monthly payments, on-time vs late, remaining balance

### Tools
- **SQL:** Querying and aggregating client and payment data
- **Excel & Tableau:** Dashboards, delinquency trends, and risk analysis
- **Python (light use):** Data cleaning and simple calculations

### Key Insights
- Identified clients at highest risk of missed payments using loan age and payment history
- Found patterns of late payments clustered around variable interest rate adjustments
- Automated recurring reports reduced manual reporting time significantly
