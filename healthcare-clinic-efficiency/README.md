# 📊 Improving Clinic Efficiency with SQL & Tableau

### Objective
Evaluate appointment efficiency and patient throughput for a regional healthcare clinic. Analyze bottlenecks in scheduling and recommend improvements using SQL and data visualization.

---

### 🔍 Key Questions:
- What is the average wait time by provider?
- How many patients are no-shows vs. completed visits each month?
- Which providers are overbooked relative to appointment duration?
- Are there no-show patterns based on patient demographics?

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
SQL • Excel • Tableau • Data Visualization • Healthcare Analytics

---

### 📈 Key Insights:
- Providers like Dr. Patel and Dr. Smith showed average wait times exceeding 25 minutes.
- No-shows peaked in May and June, particularly among patients aged 18–34.
- Overbooking was correlated with longer wait times and missed visits.
- Recommendations included buffer scheduling, automated reminders, and demographic-targeted outreach.
