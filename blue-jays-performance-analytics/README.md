# ⚾ Blue Jays Performance Analytics

End-to-end analysis of the **Toronto Blue Jays** using **SQL + Python (pandas/matplotlib)**. This project explores player trends, bullpen strength, lineup efficiency, and game-level outcomes, and presents the findings in a clean web page (`index.html`) with exportable charts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives / Key Questions
- Which hitters are driving on-base and slugging outcomes?
- How does the rotation/bullpen perform in strikeouts and run prevention?
- Where are the peaks/troughs in run production month by month?
- How do the Jays stack up against key rivals?

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- **SQL** — extract and aggregate player/game stats for season trends.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** — clean data and generate visuals.
- **HTML/CSS** — polished presentation page for a recruiter-friendly view.
