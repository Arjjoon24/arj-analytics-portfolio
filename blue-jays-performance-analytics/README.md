# âš¾ Blue Jays Performance Analytics  

This project analyzes player and team performance for the **Toronto Blue Jays**, blending **SQL** and **Python** to extract insights from game and player-level data. The goal is to evaluate performance trends, highlight standout players, and uncover factors that drive wins and losses.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals  
- Analyze **hitting and pitching performance** at both player and team levels  
- Identify **season trends** (e.g., batting averages, strikeouts, ERA)  
- Compare individual contributions to overall team success  
- Use **SQL** for structured queries and **Python** for deeper analysis and visualization  

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources  
- **Mock datasets** created to simulate game logs, player stats, and season summaries  
- Includes hitting, pitching, and fielding data (CSV/Excel format in `/data`)  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Methods  
- **SQL** â†’ Run queries for aggregations, leaderboards, and performance splits  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** â†’ Clean data, calculate advanced metrics, and generate visuals  
- **Charts/Dashboards** â†’ Created from both SQL queries and Python plots, stored in `/assets`  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights (Sample)  
- Which Blue Jays players contribute most to runs scored?  
- How does pitching performance vary across starters vs. bullpen?  
- What player stats are most correlated with team wins?
