# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a simulated telecom service provider. It combines **SQL analysis**, **visual dashboards**, and a **custom HTML dashboard** to showcase actionable insights and retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Measure churn rates across customer plans and regions
- Identify key churn drivers (complaints, usage, demographics)
- Present findings in a visually interactive HTML dashboard

## Data
Simulated dataset with 3 tables:
- **Customers:** Demographics, plan type, churn flag
- **Usage:** Monthly data usage and call minutes
- **Complaints:** Monthly complaints per customer

## Tools
- **SQL:** Joins, aggregations, churn segmentation
- **Excel/Tableau:** Visualizations of churn trends and drivers
- **HTML/CSS:** Dashboard presentation of insights

## Key Insights
- Basic plan customers have the highest churn
- Higher complaint frequency correlates strongly with churn
- Retained customers typically consume more monthly data
