# Customer Churn Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a simulated telecom service provider. Using SQL for data analysis, Tableau/Excel for visualization, and an HTML dashboard for presentation, it demonstrates how to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable retention strategies.

### Objectives
- Calculate churn rates across plans and demographics
- Identify key factors driving churn (usage, complaints, tenure)
- Build visualizations and present findings in an interactive HTML dashboard

### Data
Simulated dataset including:
- **Customers Table:** demographics, plan type, signup date
- **Usage Table:** monthly data usage, call minutes
- **Complaints Table:** number of complaints per month
- **Churn Flag Table:** whether the customer churned (Yes/No)

### Tools
- **SQL:** Joins, aggregations, churn segmentation
- **Excel/Tableau:** Visual dashboards for churn trends and factors
- **HTML/CSS:** Basic dashboard to present insights in portfolio format

### Key Insights
- Higher churn among lower-tier plans and heavy complaint users
- Seasonal churn spikes during billing cycle renewals
- Recommendations: improve complaint resolution, loyalty perks for at-risk plans
